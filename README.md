# 🎙️ Automated Podcast Transcription & Topic Segmentation – GenAI Internship Lab

Welcome to the GenAI Internship Lab.

This internship project focuses on building a real-world, production-style system for:

Automated podcast transcription, intelligent topic segmentation, and semantic analysis using GenAI and Machine Learning.

Interns will design and implement an end-to-end pipeline that converts raw podcast audio into:
- Accurate transcripts
- Meaningful topic segments
- Searchable knowledge
- Structured summaries and insights

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a GenAI-powered platform that can:

- Convert long-form podcast audio into clean text (ASR)
- Automatically segment conversations into topics
- Generate structured summaries
- Enable semantic search and Q&A over episodes
- Apply safety, cost-awareness, and human review flows

This simulates real industry use cases such as:
Media intelligence platforms, ed-tech tools, content analytics systems, and enterprise knowledge assistants.

---

## 🧠 Core Learning Areas

Interns will gain hands-on experience in:

- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Topic segmentation and semantic chunking
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt engineering and prompt safety
- Human-in-the-loop system design
- Cost-optimized GenAI pipelines
- Cloud-ready API development

---

## 🏗️ Expected System Architecture

A typical solution may include:

1. Audio ingestion layer  
2. Transcription service (e.g., Whisper or equivalent)  
3. Text cleaning & normalization  
4. Topic segmentation (ML or LLM-assisted)  
5. Embedding & vector storage  
6. RAG-based Q&A or insight generation  
7. Safety filters & confidence scoring  
8. Human validation workflow  
9. API / UI layer  

Interns are encouraged to design modular, production-style pipelines.

## 🧩 Core Functional Requirements

Each intern project must demonstrate:

- End-to-end transcription flow
- Logical topic segmentation
- Meaningful use of LLMs
- At least one GenAI-powered feature (summary, Q&A, insights, tagging, etc.)
- Prompt safety handling
- Cost-aware design choices
- Clear documentation and reproducibility

---

## 🛡️ Responsible AI Expectations

All systems must consider:

- Hallucination control  
- Sensitive content handling  
- Prompt injection risks  
- Confidence-based fallbacks  
- Human review for low-trust outputs  

Production thinking is mandatory.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

Each intern must submit:

- Working codebase
- Architecture explanation
- README documentation
- Sample inputs and outputs
- Demo screenshots or video
- Clear run instructions



---

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each intern should create their own folder inside `Intern_Submissions/`.
